<p>The output from the simulations needs to be collected first from the csv output. Another aspect of the output is that each simulation gives the p-value of the indirect path as just the cumulative probability. We want to reject the null for any indirect path where that is either &lt; .025 or &gt; .975. I’ll summarize the output to look at the error rate (any null rejection) for each subset of simulation input (a path, b path, and c_p path). There are three ways I could imagine getting a p-value from the permutation-generated confidence interval – first, subtracting the mean of all permutations, to center the CI around 0, <code>p_ab_perm_mean_c</code>; second, centering that distribution around the model-estimated a*b path, <code>p_ab_perm_ab_c</code>; and third, taking the proportion of the CI that is below 0. In the final case, to keep the test two-sided, we reject the null when &gt; .025 proportion of the tail is of the sign opposite the indirect effect estimate.</p>
